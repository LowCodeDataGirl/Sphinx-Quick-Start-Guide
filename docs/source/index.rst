This documentation is tailored to provide a straightforward and engaging introduction to Sphinx,
the powerful documentation tool used by developers worldwide.  

It aims to establish a foundational understanding of Sphinx, leading you through the creation of a basic yet comprehensive two-page documentation. 

You will learn about Sphinx's capabilities and how to use them effectively to create documentation that is not only informative but also visually appealing and user-friendly.

No prior knowledge is required; we will start from the very beginning and gradually build up to more complex concepts. 

At the end of this guide, you'll have your documentation and understand not just the how but also the why behind each step.
